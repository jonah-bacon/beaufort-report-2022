Welcome to the 2022 analysis folder. 

If you are copying this over in 2023, paste all these files, rename them, change curr_yr to 2023, and point to the 2023 files.
Most code *should* work but you'll inevitably have to go line by line on a lot of it.  
You'll want to start with the import script, then use the QAQC file. After that, you can use any of the scripts in any order.
The .html and .docx files are automatically created with the correspondingly named .Rmd file.
